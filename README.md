# Algebraic-Geometry-Seminar
Repository for holding my Algebraic Geometry Seminar Project.

The project presentation may be found by clicking on PresentationAlgGeom.pdf, or clicking [here](https://github.com/alanhahn07/Algebraic-Geometry-Seminar/blob/main/Presentation/PresentationAlgGeom.pdf); the corresponding document in which I included diagrams and gave more detail to selected proofs may be found by clicking on DiagramsandExplanations.pdf, or clicking [here](https://github.com/alanhahn07/Algebraic-Geometry-Seminar/blob/main/DiagramsandExplanations.pdf). 

The project is an expository one, in which I gave an overview of the first half of chapter 16 - Modules of Differentials - from the book Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry. There is also a (rather long) video of the presentation that I am happy to send upon request.
